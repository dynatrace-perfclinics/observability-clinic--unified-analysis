# WMI-Extension-Tutorial
A step by step tutorial for a simple Dynatrace (WMI) Extension 2.0


## Description

This tutorial will guide you step by step through building a complete 2.0 Extension with Dynatrace. You will be building a WMI Extension that runs on the OneAgent and monitors a Windows Host. You will learn the following features of the framework:
* Extension development cycle
* Using WMI as a Data Source
* Adding metadata to your metrics
* Creating a topology model for the extension
* Designing nice analysis screens
* Shipping assets with your extension

**Please make sure you have read and completed the [prerequsites](/0_Prerequisites) before starting.**

## Format and instructions

### Each exercise has a description

This gives you details of the concepts being covered in the exercise as well as hints and tips on how to complete the exercise.

### Each exercise has tasks
Each exercise requires you to complete a series of tasks. You must complete all tasks to advance to the next exercise.

Each exercise leaves you with a working Extension 2.0. By the end, you will have deployed 6 versions of a WMI extension.

### Choose your difficulty
* New to extensions 2.0 - use the `template.yaml` included with each exercise and just fill in the blanks
* Familiar with extensions 2.0 - write everything from scratch.
  * Use the Extensions API ([schemas](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/api-extensions-20-get-all-files) and [schema](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/environment-api/extensions-v2/schemas/get-file/)) to browse schemas instead of peeking in the template

If you get stuck, the `solution.yaml` offers the complete solution to the exercise.
